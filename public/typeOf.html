      <h2>1.Deceased Donor Donation:</h2>
      
      <ul>
      <li><h3>Standard Deceased Donation:</h3></li>
      <p>Organs are donated from individuals who have been declared brain dead or have suffered cardiac death. Organs are recovered shortly after death and transplanted into recipients.</p>
      <li><h3>Donation after Circulatory Death (DCD):</h3></li>
      <p>In DCD, organs are recovered from individuals who have died from circulatory arrest, but whose organs are still viable for transplantation. Donation occurs after a period of cessation of blood circulation.</p>
      <li><h3>Donation after Brain Death (DBD): </h3></li>
      <p>DBD involves the recovery of organs from individuals who have been declared brain dead, meaning there is irreversible loss of brain function while other bodily functions are artificially maintained.</p></ul>
    

    
      <h2>2.Living Donor Donation:</h2>
        <!-- <div class="living">        <img src="../image/donate.jpg"  class="living" alt="">
        </div> -->
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Living Kidney Donation: </h3></li>
        <p>
          Living individuals donate one of their kidneys to someone in need of a kidney transplant. The remaining kidney is sufficient for the donor's own health.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Living Liver Donation:</h3></li>
        <p> A portion of the liver is donated by a living donor to a recipient in need of a liver transplant. The liver has the ability to regenerate, allowing both the donor and recipient to recover fully.</p>
        <li><h3>Living Lung Donation:</h3></li>
        <p> In rare cases, a portion of a lung may be donated by a living donor to a recipient with lung disease. This type of donation is less common than kidney or liver donation.</p>
        <li><h3>Living Tissue Donation:</h3></li>
        <p>Living individuals can also donate tissues such as skin, bone, corneas, and blood stem cells to help recipients in need of tissue transplantation.</p>
      </ul>
      <h2>3.Directed Donation:</h2>
      <ul><li>In directed donation, the donor specifies a particular recipient for their organ or tissue donation. This is often done for family members or close friends in need of a transplant.</li></ul>

      <h2>4.Non-Directed Donation:

      </h2>
        <ul><li>Non-directed donation, also known as altruistic donation, involves donating organs or tissues without specifying a particular recipient. The donation is made with the intention of helping any recipient in need.</li></ul>

        <h2>5.Paired Exchange Donation:


        </h2>
          <ul><li>In paired exchange donation, incompatible donor-recipient pairs are matched with other pairs to facilitate kidney transplantation. This allows recipients to receive a compatible kidney from a donor in another pair, while their own incompatible donor donates to another recipient in need.</li></ul>

          <h2>6.Posthumous Organ Pledge

          </h2>
            <ul><li>Some individuals pledge to donate their organs after death by registering as organ donors with relevant authorities or organizations. This ensures that their organs can be used for transplantation upon their death.</li></ul>
